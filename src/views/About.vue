    <div class="container box">This app is a to-do list for nerds. Right now, it's just a super simple list.
      But it will eventually be a Kanban-tyle to-do, so  you'll be
    able to drag/drop tasks into different categories. Also, once you've achieved "done" status,
    you'll be awarded a badge. Not sure how that will work yet, but I've got a bunch of nerdy developer
    badges to hand out, so it should be fun. </div>
